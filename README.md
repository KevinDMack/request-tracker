# Admin-Request-Tracker

Currently, one constant seems to be that requests toward ultimate goals require movements through disparate systems, and tracking what needs to be done, and what the status is can be an ongoing challenge.  This represents an attempt to track these requests across multiple systems and approvals to be completed to deliver an ultimate goal. 

# Goal

By leveraging AI, and the cloud we can create an ability to provide a solution for tracking efforts and coordinating across disparate systems towards a common goal.  And leverage a chat based solution to help navigate these challlenges.  

The following are the key use-cases that are being targeted by this solution:
- I as a user, have a request that needs work through a defined workflow to get that request accomplished.
- I as a user, want support to create my request, and then send emails, or make API calls to kick off next steps in the system.
- I as a user, what to see my requests are, and where they are in the process.
- I as a user, want to know where I can find more information on each step.
- I as a workflow admin, want to be able to build and modify my workflows that are available to be created and monitored.
- I as a user, want to be able to chat with a RAG solution to get updates and options as my request moves through the workflow.
